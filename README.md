# Finetuning
For this project, the Llama 2 7b model was fine-tuned using the Hugging Face framework. The framework provides efficient tools for training and fine-tuning transformer-based models on specific tasks. After fine-tuning, the model was saved to the Hugging Face model hub, allowing easy access  and deployment for further analysis and application.
